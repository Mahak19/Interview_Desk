# Interview_Desk
AI Interview Coach is a web-based application designed to help users practice for technical job interviews in a realistic and interactive way. The app simulates a live video interview environment where users can see themselves on camera and respond to dynamically generated questions from an AI interviewer.

*Key Features*
1. Camera Based Interface
2. Real-time AI Interviewer
3. Chat-style interaction
4. Clean, responsive UI
5. And Many More To Go....

*Technical Highlights*
I. Built using React (with TypeScript) and a module-based import system.
II. Webcam access is handled via the browser’s MediaDevices API, with proper permission handling and cleanup.
III. The interview logic is designed to be lightweight and conversational, making it feel like a real dialogue rather than a scripted test.

This project is still in active development, and I'm currently working on improving its features and user experience. There’s much more to come as I continue refining the AI interactions, UI, and functionality ;)
